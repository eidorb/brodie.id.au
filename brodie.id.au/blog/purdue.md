# Purdue model

The [Purdue model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purdue_Enterprise_Reference_Architecture) (also referred to as _Purdoodle muddle_) is not a security architecture model[^1].

:alt: At least it does not identify as a Pie Ass Fuck?

Well, *technically*, it should identify as Purdue Level 3.15149 Pi As Fuck because it's a genderless XIoT device.

## A brief history of networks

In the not-so-distant past, today‚Äôs network technologies weren‚Äôt so common.
Less so in industrial control system (ICS) networks.
Trendy folk were starting to use a force called ‚Äúthe Ethernet‚Äù.
While others began to summon the ‚Äúthe Internet Protocol‚Äù.

Ethernet, a LAN technology, operates on shared media.
Back then, people claim, you had to be strong to ram things into a big-ass coaxial cable, or something like that.
All frames (yes, even non-broadcast frames) competed for an opportunity to speak on the cable.
If more than one host spoke at the same time, a collision would occur.
Frames spoken would be forever lost...
Until a host spoke again. \
A retransmission, perhaps.

Modern networks use switches and full-duplex Ethernet to segment LANs into many collision domains.
Frames can, for the most part, be spoken without fear of collision and oblivion.

There‚Äôs nothing to stop you connecting an old-school bus network or hub to your modern network.
But in that particular segment, you‚Äôll lose the benefits of a collision-free modern network.


## Ethernet adoption in ICS networks

The IT world was rapidly realising the simplicity and interoperability of Ethernet networks.
The ICS world observed this too.

New expansion card product lines began to appear on the market.
Engineers began installing sensors and controllers with Ethernet capabilities.
This got rid of lots of point-to-point serial cabling.
Tapping into an Ethernet bus was *simp*ler.

SCADA servers, HMIs and operator consoles began to appear on the network.
And production management systems. \
And building management systems too. \
Some solar thing. \
And metering. \
...[IoT](https://x.com/internetofshit).

Why not connect to the administrative staff's computer network too?
It's easier to run reports that way.

Long-term production history databases. \
Payroll systems in some places. \
Backup server spaces.

Countless. \
Hidden. \
Disgraces.

Don't forget printers for endless pages of nuisance alarms.

Uh-oh! \
LAN performance started to tank.
All systems were speaking at the same time.
Ethernet cannot guarantee delivery of frames.
Especially not with all these collisions.

Was this new Ethernet thing all hype?
It had poor performance.
Engineers require (close to) deterministic performance, otherwise their systems could become unreliable.
(Just like the network.)


## A solution

The Purdue Enterprise Reference Architecture was created to help with network performance[^2].
It is a simple guide to segmenting networks by function.
Network engineers may have designed networks like this without a model.
Others could follow the reference architecture and achieve good enough results.

Why? A network with one collision domain is about as bad as it gets.
If the number of hosts in the network is held constant, then creating more segments (collision domains) has to result in better performance. The more segments, the greater the performance.
But with more segments comes greater complexity, management overhead, and specialist skills.

The Purdue model attempts to strike a balance.

The Purdue model does not mention layer 3 segments (subnets) or even VLANs.
The Purdue model instructs you to perform layer 1 segmentation.
And modern networks kinda already do this for you.
In modern networks, each host typically lives in its own collision domain.
(That blue cable binding host to switch.)

Poor performance due solely to collisions is probably not much of an issue in well-configured networks.
You can achieve good network performance with a single flat network today.
But high-performance flat networks have downsides too.


## A common misconception

Engineers were at ease.
Their networks had low error rates.
The Purdue model worked.
And networks continued to perform acceptably on into this age of modern networks.

But did it work *because* of the Purdue model?
Because in spite of models, modern flat networks are essentially collision-free.

Security became a thing.
Or maybe a lack of security had started to get physical?

Some had assumed the instructions were to interpret each Purdue level as a layer 3 network.
And everything would be okay with a firewall between those networks.
But the Purdue model is more about reliability and less about information security.
Firewalls between levels is a start, but I think we can do better.

Forcing the Purdue model on your networks will result in bizarre pseudo-levels.
Watch for fl[üõü](https://study.com/skill/learn/identifying-numbers-as-integers-or-non-integers-explanation.html)ating Purdue levels like level 3.5: *RUN DMZ*[^3].
No, it is not in the Purdue Enterprise Reference Architecture[^2].
Notice any confusion that arises when attempting to fit a square network management interface in a round Purdue level.
If the Purdue model is a network segmentation model, then network management is out of scope.


## Advice

If you find yourself face-to-face with the Purdue model in a conference call, please confirm you are not speaking with an [LLM](https://x.com/i/grok/share/GylL24RlT2ZM0ZgeNeBB8vLF8).
